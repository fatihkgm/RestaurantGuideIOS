<p align="center">This project is a mobile application that will be built using swift. With the intended
devices being IOS mobile. It is aimed at people in all age groups and will come to
their aid whenever they are trying to choose a restaurant to go to. Our project will
aim to take away all the guesswork involved with finding which restaurant is good or
not by providing an all in one guide to all restaurants in the user’s area.
As mentioned above, the project will be built utilizing swift and xcode. The app
would present the user with two options at first, if they have a restaurant in mind,
they can search it immediately and it will display all relevant information about it that
may influence the users decision on whether or not they will eat there.
The second option would allow the user to view a directory of restaurants in their
area. In this menu they can view a small picture of the restaurant, the average price,
general review, aswell as the address and phone number with a very brief
description of what the restaurant is.</p>
