# RestaurantGuideIOS

ðŸ“Œ PROJECT DESCRIPTION. 
This project is a mobile application that will be built using swift. With the intended
devices being IOS mobile. It is aimed at people in all age groups and will come to
their aid whenever they are trying to choose a restaurant to go to. Our project will
aim to take away all the guesswork involved with finding which restaurant is good or
not by providing an all in one guide to all restaurants in the userâ€™s area.
As mentioned above, the project will be built utilizing swift and xcode. The app
would present the user with two options at first, if they have a restaurant in mind,
they can search it immediately and it will display all relevant information about it that
may influence the users decision on whether or not they will eat there.
The second option would allow the user to view a directory of restaurants in their
area. In this menu they can view a small picture of the restaurant, the average price,
general review, aswell as the address and phone number with a very brief
description of what the restaurant is. Furthermore, there is going to be another
search bar aswell as a sort option to allow the user to put in various tags such as
â€˜italianâ€™ to only display restaurants that serve Italian dishes.
Finally, the user would be able to click on an actual listing. Through there they
will see a map of the restaurant and its surroundings using google API. From there,
theyâ€™ll be able to click on the map to get directions to it, see the same information
they saw on the other screen, as well as a longer description of the restaurant. With
methods of contacting the restaurant above the description. Below all of that, the
user will be able to find various reviews from patrons of the restaurant itself.
Scrolling through it and checking out what everyone liked or disliked about the
restaurant. And finally, the user would be able to actually review the restaurant itself,
being able to rate it out of 5 stars and edit them as they wished should they ever
have a positive or negative experience at the restaurant at a later date.
All of these features can be viewed in the sample UIâ€™s created below.
